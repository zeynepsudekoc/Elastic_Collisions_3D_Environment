Elastic Collisions in a 3D Environment

In this project, a dynamic sphere simulation has been created using OpenGL. This simulation was developed using the OpenGL and GLFW libraries.
Getting Started

These instructions will explain how to run and develop the project on a local machine.
Requirements

You will need the following software and libraries to run and develop this project:

    CMake
    GLFW
    GLEW
    glm
    A C++ compiler (for example, g++, VS)

Installation

Clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project1.git

Go to the project directory:
cd Project1

Run the created executable:
./Project1.sln


Usage

When the project is running, you will see spheres moving dynamically inside the window. You can control the camera view with keyboard keys. For example:

    W: Move forward
    S: Move backward
    A: Move left
    D: Move right

You can use the ESC key to close the project.
